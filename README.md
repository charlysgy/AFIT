## Builtin
The Builtin directory is meant to host basic maths operations and popular basic encryption methods.
### builtin.ml
val sign : int -> int = \<fun\>
Function that return -1 if the given integer is negative, 1 if it is positive.

val quot : int -> int -> int = \<fun\> 
Function that perform a division between two number in the euclidian division manner

val modulo : int -> int -> int = \<fun\>
Function that perform a modulus operation, the first integer is the one on which to perform the modulus operation with the second integer as the modulus

val div : int -> int -> int * int = <fun>
Function that return the result of quot and modulo for the two given integers

### basic_arithmetics.ml
val gdc int -> int -> int = \<fun\> Function that compute the gcd of two given integers
